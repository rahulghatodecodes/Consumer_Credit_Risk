# Consumer Credit Risk

## Overview
The data frame contains of 10k customers having records of whether customers defaulted on their credit card debt or not. We can break down the data frame into 4 variables:
- Default:  A factor with levels No and Yes indicating whether the customer defaulted on their debt
- Student:  A factor with levels No and Yes indicating whether the customer is a student
- Balance:  The average balance that the customer has remaining on their credit card after making their monthly payment
- Income:   Income of customer

## Objective
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Implement a Logistic Regression Model

## Programming Language & Tools
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- MS Excel

## Actions
- Checked the basic measures of descriptive statistics for the continuous variables(default, student, balance, income). 
- Carried out Univariate Analysis and Bivariate Analysis. 
- Checked for correlation between independent variables. 
- Checked the missing values. 
- Treated outliers present in the ’balance’ variable.

## Inference
- Defaulters seem to have higher outstanding balance compared non-defaulters. 
- Defaulters’ income seems lower compared to non-defaulters.

## Results
Implemented logistic Regression model. Accuracy of the model was 88%.
