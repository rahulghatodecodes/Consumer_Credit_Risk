# Consumer_Credit_Risk
Data frame contains information of 10k customers having records of whether customers defaulted on their
credit card debt or not. 

## Action

Checked the basic measures of descriptive statistics for the continuous variables(default,
student, balance, income). 
Carried out Univariate Analysis and Bivariate Analysis. 
Checked for correlation between independent variables. 
Checked the missing values. 
Treated outliers present in the ’balance’ variable.


- Default:  A factor with levels No and Yes indicating whether the customer defaulted on their debt
- Student:  A factor with levels No and Yes indicating whether the customer is a student
- Balance: The average balance that the customer has remaining on their credit card after making their monthly payment
- Income:   Income of customer

## Observations
Defaulters seem to have higher outstanding balance compared non-defaulters. Defaulters’ income seems lower
compared to non-defaulters.
Implemented logistic Regression model. Accuracy of the model was 88%
